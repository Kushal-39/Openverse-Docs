# OPENVERSE

Openverse is the open-source club at IIIT Kottayam. We are a group of students driven by creativity, collaboration, and a passion for open source. Our goal is to build useful tools, contribute to projects, and grow a community focused on real-world technology.

## üåü What We Build

Some of our public projects include:
- **DSA Website**: Interactive visualizations of algorithms and data structures
- **Ferrari OS**: A custom Arch based Linux distribution with Hyprland, custom shell, and automation tools
- **IIITK-Deepseek**: Local LLM tuned for IIIT Kottayam specific stuff.
- **LinkedIn Blocker**: A Chrome extension to filter feed content
- Other tools like **CGPA Predictor** and **Research Site**

## üí° Our Mission

Instead of passive tutorials, we focus on:
- **Hands on projects** such as Chrome extensions and Linux distributions
- **Real contributions** to open source ecosystems
- **Documentation first** workflows using modern MDX based sites (powered by Fumadocs and GitHub)

## üß≠ Who We Are

We are a core team of students from IIIT Kottayam: designers, developers, writers, and idea creators. We welcome everyone and believe in building in public. You do not need to be a coder; you can write documentation, design user interfaces, or suggest new features.

## ü§ù How to Join or Contribute

- Fork or clone any repository under [Openverse iiitk GitHub]
- Open a pull request, even for documentation or readme improvements
- Reach out on Discord or Telegram, no bureaucracy
- Our only rule: keep it constructive and work in public

## üöÄ Why It Matters

We are building a culture where students do more than just hack. We architect, explain, and scale what we create. Whether it is an AI assistant or a productivity tool, it lives in code, documentation, and community.
