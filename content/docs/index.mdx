# What is Open Source?

Open source refers to software whose source code is made freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This approach encourages collaboration, transparency, and community-driven development.

## Key Principles

- **Transparency:** Anyone can inspect the code and understand how it works.
- **Collaboration:** Developers from around the world can contribute improvements and fixes.
- **Freedom:** Users can use, modify, and share the software without restrictions.

## Benefits of Open Source

- **Security:** More eyes on the code means vulnerabilities are found and fixed faster.
- **Innovation:** Community contributions lead to rapid improvements and new features.
- **Cost:** Most open source software is free to use.
- **Flexibility:** Users can adapt the software to their specific needs.
